# My Neovim Repository

I initially used kickstart.nvim with a few modifications, but I stupidly reset my forked repo and lost all my changes (lessons learned). So instead of recovering my changes I have decided to try create my own nvim config, which is the lovely attempt that is this repository. 

I hope you like it!
