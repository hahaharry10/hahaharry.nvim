# My Neovim Repository

I had a lovely config using kickstart.nvim and some modifications, but when migrating to Kali Linux I came accross some incompatibilities. When trying to update my kickstart.nvim config and fix the problems I somehow lost all my modifications (lesson learned). So instead of recovering my changes I have decided to try create my own nvim config, but this time dedeveloped on Kali Linux, which is the lovely attempt that is this repository. 

I hope you like it!
